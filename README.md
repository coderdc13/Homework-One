In addition, according to https://www.alchemypartners.co.uk/, in terms of a description of the founding company, “Alchemy was established to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns in private equity and distressed investing. This remains our focus. Working with and alongside management teams is a central component of our approach, to create and grow value by solving problems, investing behind them, helping take difficult decisions and driving through change.”
### How did the idea of the company come about?
Chief Information Officer (CIO) Russ Fitzgerald stated in https://www.fintechmagazine.com/company/hampshire-trust-bank-using-digital-transformation-improve-human-interaction-not-replace-it that the current manifestation of Hampshire Business Trust relies heavily on "the strong desire to transform to a financial services that relies heavily on technology." In this article, the CIO also states the desire to change to “provide a first-rate service, delivering dynamic support for smaller banks” (https://www.fintechmagazine.com/company/hampshire-trust-bank-using-digital-transformation-improve-human-interaction-not-replace-it). In addition, Mr. Fitzgerald stated that a major reconceptualization of HTB focused on the “prioritised plans for technology and infrastructure development” (https://www.fintechmagazine.com/company/hampshire-trust-bank-using-digital-transformation-improve-human-interaction-not-replace-it). The goal of this reorganization is to “improve operational efficiency, credit risk processes, and customer and broker experience” (https://www.fintechmagazine.com/company/hampshire-trust-bank-using-digital-transformation-improve-human-interaction-not-replace-it).
### How is the company funded? How much funding has HTB received?
The company has been funded since 2014 by the members of the acquiring party, Alchemy Partners LLP. At least in the period from 2016 to late 2017, through its operations as a bank, HTB has received at least one hundred million (100,000,000) GBP, according to https://www.htb.co.uk/latest-news/hampshire-trust-bank-profit-more-than-doubles-as-bank-continues-to-grow/. Furthermore, according to https://thebanks.eu/banks/14353, the total assets of HTB were calculated to be at least one billion twenty four million (1,024,000,000) GBP. Neither the details of the acquisition by Alchemy Partners LLP nor the details of the amount of funding received by HTB since the acquisition have been disclosed, but based on the sources, one could state that HTB has generated at least half a billion GBP in funding since its acquisition.
## Business Activities
### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
HTB identifies itself as a specialist bank (https://www.htb.co.uk/). One may define a specialist bank as a smaller bank that customizes and tailors its services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html). A specialist bank solves the problems faced by SMEs in dealing with larger banks (https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html). Specifically, according to https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html, "Too often, smaller enterprises do not meet the strict lending criteria set out by some of these larger banks, and this has increasingly driven demand for more customisable solutions.In turn this has paved the way for the emergence of alternative finance providers and the wave of specialist banks. These new finance options bring with them a diversification of products to service those businesses thathave largely been neglected by bigger UK banking institutions."
### What is the company’s intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of clients? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer (what is the unfair advantage that this bank utilizes)?
HTB's intended customer is the individual and the SME. According to https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/British-Business-Bank-Small-Business-Finance-Markets-Report-2015-16.pdf through https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html, "Some 60% of SMEs seeking bank finance still only approach only one provider, whilearound 90% of SMEs go to their main business current account bank for overdrafts, general purpose business loans and credits cards." In terms of competitive edge, according to https://www.fintechmagazine.com/brochure/hampshire-trust-bank-using-digital-transformation-improve-human-interaction-not-replace-it, HTB leverages a combination of close analysis of client needs (from intimate working relationships) and a specially tailored application programming interface (API) from partners.
### Which technologies is this bank currently using, and how is this bank implementing them?
Recently, HTB has touted its technology partnerships with such firms as Matillion, InterWorks, and Snowflake, Incorporated in terms of forming a data and artificial-intelligence led analytical platform and dashboard (https://www.htb.co.uk/insights/htb-positions-data-at-the-heart-of-decision-making-with-tech-investments/). However, in terms of leveraging the above-mentioned API system, HTB relies on technology from three (3) firms: Phoebus, APA, ICA Consultancy.
#### Phoebus
According to https://www.phoebus.co.uk/solutions/, "Phoebus is a real time system, as all actions have immediate effect. So you can make better-informed decisions, more quickly. Because of its built-in flexibility, Phoebus allows you to react rapidly to changing market needs. It automates so much of your administration, too: creating letters and documents, and integrated with a document imaging system. What’s more, you can access management information through a data mart and report generator that includes regulatory reports."
#### APAK
In its website at https://www.apakgroup.com/, APAK states that "Apak Group, a Sopra Banking Software company, develops, implements and supports innovative global software solutions for the wholesale floorplan and banking sectors. We've done it for four decades and we're still innovating. Our teams provide integrated business consultancy and IT services to ensure our clients' commercial aspirations are met – and exceeded."
#### ICA Consultancy
According to https://icaconsultancy.co.uk/services-assist/cisoaas/, ICA states that "As part of our Assist services the Chief Information Security Officer-as-a-Service (CISOaaS) provides access to the capabilities required to respond to the threats of today and plan for those of tomorrow. For some organisations hiring a Chief Information Security Officer is simply cost prohibitive, and for others attracting and retaining the right talent is challenging. Either way, the impact of a cyber-attack or data breach can still be significant. Often what is required is simply access to the right capabilities at the right time."
## Landscape
### In what domain of the financial industry is the company?
HTB operates in the domain of specialist banking. According to https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html, specialist banks "offer specific lending products and a more personalised service is what stands [us] apart when it comes to choosing a finance provider." In addition, according to https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html, "specialist banks have firmly solidified their place in the future of finance by fostering competition and improving choice for customers. Also, our view is that SMEs value long-term relationships with lenders they can rely on to support them through the cycle."
### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last five to ten (5-10) years?
According to https://specialistbanking.co.uk/article-desc-7322_Believe%20the%20hype%20%E2%80%93%20why%20explainable%20AI%20is%20a%20trend%20that%E2%80%99s%20here%20to%20stay, the latest and most dominant trend is "explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)." The article states that "The banking sector, like every other, is feeling the pressing need to move towards bespoke solutions with greater transparency — as a result, there is increased appetite to leverage the power that XAI can bring to banking. The use of AI in decision making has received criticism recently for its perceived biases and lack of transparency surrounding its outcomes. There has also been some scepticism among consumers, who can be reticent to share their personal data. Yet it is only in doing so that they can receive the personalised services they crave and that provide them with what they actually need. Fortunately, XAI models can help overcome these concerns, illustrating to customers the value in sharing their data, while also reassuring them that it will be used in an appropriate and non-biased way" (https://specialistbanking.co.uk/article-desc-7322_Believe%20the%20hype%20%E2%80%93%20why%20explainable%20AI%20is%20a%20trend%20that%E2%80%99s%20here%20to%20stay).
### What are the other major companies in this domain?
According to specialistbanking.co.uk, at https://specialistbanking.co.uk/banks.php?id=&page=4, competitors include Tide (tide.co), U Account (https://www.uaccount.uk/), and Tesco Bank (https://www.tescobank.com/). There seem to be many other competitors, based on the list of banks. It is important to note that some of these banks have lost their websites.
## Results
### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Most likely, HTB would claim that it satisfies "the need for a different shape of bank – one built on investing in traditional banking relationships, hiring individuals with experience put inthe time in to understand the challenges and opportunities that a particular organisation faces nowand in the future" (https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html). It has been asserted at https://yculz33w9skgdkhey8rajqm6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SnapLogic-Hampshire-Trust-Bank-Case-Study.pdf that HTB offers greater agility and data-driven options for clients. HTB may well offer the model of a small, traditional bank being reinvigorated into a growing giant based on data, technology, and close client relationships.
### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Perhaps the chief core metric is assets. In terms of assets, https://thebanks.eu/banks/14353 states that HTB is the "102nd largest bank in the United Kingdom." Also, https://thebanks.eu/banks/14353 states that HTB has a "market share of 0.01%."
### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Given that other banks have lost their websites, HTB seems to be performing relatively well compared with competitors in the same domain. HTB seems to be growing and cultivating partnerships in the fintech world. At the very least, HTB may be seen as having strong public relations and media relationships in the fintech world, based on its favorable profiles.
### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination.
The student author would attempt to dominate the other specialist banks by offering a free application that gives complete details and rates from competitors in real time. Providing this free application would encourage users to register for the application (on a digital arm of HTB, of course), and as the users would increase use of this application, the users would learn more about the parent company, that is, HTB itself. The free application would provide free value, encourage potential clients, and provide an edge over competitors.
### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The company is already depending on its use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Creative leveraging of these APIs would benefit the company in that users of the proposed application would gain trust in the bank and then become clients of the bank. HTB would not have to exert much extra effort and could rely on its existing technological structures in a fine opportunity to gain more users and clients.
### What technology would this additional product or service utilize?
The technologies utilized would include machine learning, blockchain, and data science in general.
### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The proposed solution needs these technologies to render the service and also to draw any quantifiable value.

# CASE STUDY - metamask.io
![alt text](metamask.jpg)
## The student author is compelled to compose a case study about metamask.io because of the potential influence of this firm and because of the shroud of obscurity that surrounds this firm.
## Overview and Origin
### Name of Company
The name of the company is metamask.io. According to https://www.owler.com/company/metamask, this company is based in the San Francisco Bay (California, USA) area. According to https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamask, this company has 11-50 employees. The linkedin.com site lists the address as 500 Sansome Street, San Francisco (https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamask).
### When was the company incorporated?
According to https://www.owler.com/company/metamask, metamask.io was founded in 2016, but there do not seem to be any details online about the official incorporation.
### Who are the founders of the company?
According to https://www.owler.com/company/metamask, the founder is a gentleman by the name of Mr. Aaron Davis. Aaron Davis has youtube.com videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HDVgjQnNdM, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz7yVz2iYK8, and https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3x97rg/aaron_davis_explains_the_differences_between/. According to https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/kumavis, he calls himself Kumavis.
### How did the idea of the company come about?
According to https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/08/16/ethereum-with-aaron-davis/, the idea of metamask.io came about as a result of the examination of the intersections among society, philosophy, and technology by Aaron Davis (aka Kumavis).
### How is the company funded? How much funding has metamask.io received?
It seems that metamask.io is funded by ConsenSys. Based on https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/kumavis, Davis joined ConsenSys in 2015. However, metamask.io was started in 2016, based on https://www.owler.com/company/metamask. If these two accounts are true, then metamask.io was founded as a part of ConsenSys. There is less information on funding for metamask than there is financial data for HTB; the student author can find absolutely nothing on funding for metamask.io.
## Business Activities
### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Ostensibly, metamask.io may serve as a wallet for ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. However, metamask.io has been described as a gateway for decentralized applications (https://www.optimum-web.com/what-is-metamask/). Supposedly, metamask.io can serve as a bridge between average use of the internet and the world of decentralized applications (https://www.optimum-web.com/what-is-metamask/).
### What is the company’s intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of clients? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer (what is the unfair advantage that this bank utilizes)?
The intended customer is the bitcoin user and trader. Data is at https://consensys.net/. Metamask is supposed to distinguish itself through its relationship with Infura, according to https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/metamask-wallet-review/#MetaMaskvsMyEtherWallet. 
### Which technologies is this company currently using, and how is this company implementing them?
One can state that metamask.io leverages blockchain technology and technology from ethereum development. This technology comes from the Satoshi Nakamoto cryptocurrency treatise (https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper). One may possible understand metamask.io as the application of the ideas of Satoshi Nakamoto.
## Landscape
### In what domain of the financial industry is the company?
Easily, one can state that metamask.io exists in the domain of cryptocurrency. A main service of metamask.io is service as an ethereum hot storage container. In addition, metamask.io would be able to store other cryptocurrencies.
### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last five to ten (5-10) years?
One could argue that the major trend in this domain over the last year is the rush by banks to dominate blockchain technology. Blockchain technology, specifically the nature of the blockchain as a decentralized ledger, could easily threaten banking services by digital 'elimination of the middle man.' As a result, major banks have invested large sums of money in order to dominate blockchain research, use, and advantages for themselves (https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/08/15/blockchain-investment-banking-industry-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-dlt/).
### What are the other major companies in this domain?
According to https://www.owler.com/company/metamask, the major competitors are magic (https://magic.link/), bitski (https://www.bitski.com/), and portis (https://www.portis.io/).
## Results
### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Most likely, metamask.io would assert that their company makes purchasing cryptocurrency and leveraging decentralized applications easier.
### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Most likely, the major metric that companies in this domain would use is the number of downloads. Also, another metric would be the use. Definitely, another metric would be the amount of money transferred. According to https://consensys.net/, metamask.io has been downloaded more than four million (4,000,000) times.
### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Up to this point, it is almost impossible to provide a depiction of performance, even of metamask.io. There simply is not enough data. Data on company performance is almost nonexistent.
### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination.
The student author would offer some activity that would encourage new users. Specifically, the student author would offer a promotion in which new users would acquire some free ethereum. Before the user acquires the ethereum, the user would have to go through a tutorial on metamask, pass a quiz based on the tutorial, make an account, and make a wallet.
### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This service would benefit the company because it would encourage more use, more users, and educate the public about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.
### What technology would this additional product or service utilize?
Based on what already exists in the metamask.io media sphere, this additional product would not require any real new effort or technology. Any previously unused technology would support traditional education for the existing blockchain technology. At most, the new program would involve a set of interactive video modules and quizzes.
### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The additional promotional service would leverage educational technology because this technology would help users leverage the blockchain and products like metamask with more confidence.
